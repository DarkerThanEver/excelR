# excelR

A simple set of 'wrapper' routines to streamline putting data & figures from R into excel files

No matter how beautiful or creative you are in R, in the end people often want excel sheets...

Esseintially this code allows you to create a sequence (list) of sheets, which can then be written to the excel format.
Only images (graphs) and tables are supported at this moment, but I attempted to code it flexible (R6 OOP) to allo for relatively easy (future) extending

The code makes use of the openxlsx & R6 packages.

Note: there are very few comments at the moment, the code still needs to be tested more; also there's not much in terms of error checking!

The code will be updated every now and then when I find errors/bugs...
